'Call to Arms - Gates of Hell: Ostfront' Files Manager:
==============================
Custom utility I use to manage files of **Call to Arms - Gates of Hell: Ostfront** in my personal mod.

Features:
------------------------------
Utility is capable of:
1) Adding/changing prefixes of files inside a folder (for .def files it is possible to fix all 'structure' extenders programatically, so
dependencies on objects won't break).
2) Adding buffer directory to texture paths inside .mtl files.
3) Verifying textures: lists all unused and missing textures with an options to delete all unused ones (not stable for .ebm texture files)


**Note:**  Creating backup for files is a good idea, since utility behaviour depends entirely on skills of user.
